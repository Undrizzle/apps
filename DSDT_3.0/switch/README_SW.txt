DSDT2.3b.zip - Mar. 2005, 
          1. gstpSetMode function does not modify Port State any more, since STP module

    * The Switch Driver Suite Source Code is OS independent, and fully supported by Marvell.
    * The Sample Codes are tested under vxworks and Linux, and is provided for reference only.


3) General Introduction
-----------------------

The Switch driver suite is standalone program, which is independent of both OS and Platform. 
As such, applications of MSAPIs need to register platform specific functions. 
This is done by calling qdLoadDriver function. This function returns a pointer (*dev), 
which contains the device and platform information. It will then be used for each MSAPI call. 

msApiInit.c file in Diag directory and Sample\Initialization directory demonstrate 
how you can register those functions.

msApiInit.c
    qdStart is the main function to initialize Switch Driver and does the 
    followings:
    a) register the platform specific functions. 
       1.1 and 1.2 below are required.
       1.3 to 1.4 are for F2R(Remote management), it is selected 
          by flag GT_RMGMT_ACCESS in IncludemsApiDefs.h.
       1.5 to 1.8 are optional.
        1.1) readMii - BSP specific MII read function 
        1.2) writeMii - BSP specific MII write function 
        1.3) hwAccessMod - BSP supported function mode 
        1.4) hwAccess - BSP specific hardware access function 
        1.5) semCreate - OS specific semaphore create function.
        1.6) semDelete - OS specific semaphore delete function.
        1.7) semTake - OS specific semaphore take function.
        1.8) semGive - OS specific semaphore give function.

        Notes) The given example will use DB-88E6218 BSP as an example.

    b) Initialize BSP provided routine (if required).

    c) Calls qdLoadDriver routine.
        1.1) Input (GT_SYS_CONFIG) - CPU Port Number (Board Specific) and Port Mode 
        (either 1 for Forwarding mode or 0 for Hardware default mode)
        1.2) Output (GT_QD_DEV) - Contains all device (Switch) and platform specific info.
             It will be used for all API calls.

    d) Calls sysEnable (for future use.)

1. Extract the given ZIP file into c:\DSDT_3.x\switch directory(directory can be changed)
2. Edit setenv.bat file in c:\DSDT_3.x\switch\tools
3. Modify the following variables according to your setup.

5. Change directory to c:\DSDT_3.x\switch\src
6. run "make"
7. qdDrv.lib will be created in c:\DSDT_3.x\switch\Library.


6) HOW TO - Build qdDrv.o for Linux
-----------------------------------

1. Extract the given ZIP file into $HOME/DSDT_3.x/switch directory(directory can be changed)
 `   in Linux system (verified with Fedore 8.x)
2. Edit setenv file in $HOME/DSDT_3.x/switch/tools
3. Modify the following variables according to your setup.
    declare -x DSDT_USER_BASE=$HOME/DSDT_3.x/switch
    declare -x DSDT_PROJ_NAME=qdDrv

6. run "make"
7. qdDrv.o and qdDrv.map will be created in $HOME/DSDT_3.x/switch/Library.

7) HOW TO - Use Phy driver in qdDrv.o
-------------------------------------

 The Phy driver(MAD) supports Marvell Phy products. It includes the phys in switch chips. 
 From DSDT 3.0, the Switch driver added function to merge MAD driver 
 to replace original Phy regarded functions. This is an option.
 There is no any difference from original phy APIs of Switch, when it uses MAD APIs.
 For old chips, it is selectible to use ether original Phy API function or call MAD functions. The selection is setting global variable <DSDT_USE_MAD> as TRUE or FALSE.
 Run <make DSDT_USE_MAD=TRUE> to build switch driver with MAD APIs.

8) HOW TO - build driver  
-----------------------------------

 Change directory to $HOME/DSDT_3.x/
 <make switch>: to build switch driver image only.
 <make phy>: to build phy driver image only.
 <make>: to build switch and phy driver images, and switch driver does not use MAD APIs.
 <make DSDT_USE_MAD=TRUE>: to build switch and phy driver images, and switch driver uses MAD APIs.
 
9) CHANGES
-----------
1. Supports Marvell F2R (RMGMT) function.
   Added one BSP provided function and one BSP function configuration selection 
   in Device configuration. The new BSP function is HwAccess. It is a read/write integration function, 
   like Marvell's F2R(RMGMT) access function.
   The variable HwAccessMode is configuration selection parameter. It indicates 
   to use SMI or F2R function in BSP.
   The F2R support can be selected by flag <GT_RMGMT_ACCESS> in Include/msApiDefs.h. 
   Thw flag GT_RMGMT_ACCESS is useful to compatible backwards.
   Customer, who do not provider <HwAccess function>, still can set to use GT_RMGMT_ACCESS.
   The DSDT switch driver include function to allow customer use Read/Write functions only.
2. Added device group 1 to meet extended requirement of Marvell SOHO switch products.
3. Added to support new chips 88EC0xx and 6250.
4. Merged Marvell Phy Driver (MAD). 
   The qdDriver can use Phy driver to replace the Phy part of the qdDriver.
   It is selected by flag GT_USE_MAD in Include/msApiDefs.inc. Or it can be set in Makefile.
